This version of par2cmdline has been compiled and tested on the following
compilers and operating systems:

  MS Visual Studio.NET  on  Windows XP
  gcc 3.2               on  CygWin 1.3.22
  gcc 3.2.2             on  Red Hat Linux 9.0

If you wish to compile par2cmdline under a different environment, then you
should start by trying to compile with the supplied Makefile.

If you get compile errors, then the most likely place you will need to make
changes will be in par2cmdline.h, diskfile.h, and diskfile.cpp.

See the file ROADMAP for details of what each of the source files is used for.

If you successfully port par2cmdline, it would be appreciated if you could post
the details on the parchive web site at http://sourceforge.net/parchive.
