	* Reanimate par2cmdline development on new github repository
	* Merge available distro patches since 2004 0.4 release back upstream
	* Release: Version 0.5 ;)

3 January 2005 Peter B Clements

	* par2creatorsourcefile.cpp: "offset" must be updated when computing
	  file and block hashes even if progress is not being displayed.

23 June 2004 Peter B Clements

	* diskfile.cpp: Changed DiskFile::GetFileSize for WIN32
	  so that it uses _stati64() to get the size of a file.

	* par2creatorsourcefile.cpp: In UpdateHashes() the test
	  that adjusts the length of the last block of a file when
	  before updating the file hash was incorrect.

17 June 2004 Peter B Clements

	* par1repairer.cpp, par2repairer.cpp: Report empty files when
	  scanning for data.

22 April 2004 Peter B Clements

	* README: Updated to include new commandline options.

	* par2cmdline.vcproj: Update VS .NET project file with new
	  version number.

	* Released: Version 0.4.

15 April 2004 Peter B Clements

	* par2cmdline.sln, par2cmdline.vcproj: Updated.

	* commandline.cpp, commandline.h, par1repairer.cpp, par1repairer.h,
	  par2cmdline.cpp, par2cmdline.h, par2creator.cpp, par2creator.h,
	  par2creatorsourcefile.cpp, par2creatorsourcefile.h, par2repairer.cpp,
	  par2repairer.h, reedsolomon.h, par2cmdline.h: Handle -v and -q
	  options from the command line to change the amount of messages displayed.

14 April 2004 Peter B Clements

	* commandline.h, commandline.cpp: Add -c<n> option to allow the
	  number of recovery blocks to be directly specified rather than
	  indirectly via the -r<n> option. Add -l option to allow the
	  recovery file size to be limited so that the largest will have
	  just enough recovery data to reconstruct the larget source file.

	* par2creator.h, par2creator.cpp: Use the recovery block count 
	  specified via the command line instead of the redundancy % if
	  given. Allocate the sizes of recovery files so the are limited
	  if requested.

12 April 2004 Peter B Clements

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac: Detect what defines are
	  required to enable 64 bit file system support and whether or
	  not fseeko() is available.

	* diskfile.cpp: Use fseeko and 64 bit file operations if they
	  are available.

	* par2cmdline.h: Change order of include files.

	  display a shorter version of the filename.

	* datablock.h: Change DataBlock::GetDiskFile so that in returns
	  a non const DiskFile.

	* par2repairer.cpp, par2creator.cpp: Only keep source files open
	  when they are actually needed. This should allow par2 creation
	  and repair to work with large file sets on OS's with a limit
	  on the number of files that can be open simultaneously.

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.guess, config.sub, configure, 
	  depcomp, install-sh, missing, mkinstalldirs: Updated Automake to 
	  version 1.8.3 and Autoconf to version 2.59.

	* configure.ac, config.h.in, configure: Check for getopt() and 
	  getopt_long().

19 August 2003 Peter B Clements

	  number of bytes would be reported as written to disk.

13 August 2003 Peter B Clements

	* Updated par2cmdline.h: Recorrected spelling of STDC_HEADERS!

	* Updated par1repairersourcefile.cpp, par2repairersourcefile.cpp:
	  Don't treat ':' as a path separator on non Windows platforms.

2 August 2003 Peter B Clements

	* Updated par1fileformat.h, par2fileformat.h: Use memcmp when
	  comparing MAGIC strings and PACKETTYPE strings.

	* Updated par2repairer.cpp: When a good packet is found after bad
	  data, use memcpy to copy the packet header. Don't attempt to get
	  the block count directly from the verification packet (which
	  might be missing). 

	* Updated par2repairersourcefile.cpp: Add function to set the block
	  count when the verification packet is missing.
